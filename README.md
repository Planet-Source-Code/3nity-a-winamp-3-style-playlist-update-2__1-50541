### Description

Here it is.. The second update...

A Media playliste (Like in Winamp 3 and some more futures), useful for media players (even video files with subtitles - an extra file property for every entry)...

Made it (the update) upon a request, added Set Background picture Property (it can be Centred, Stretched...), fixed some reported bugs (thanx to those people)...

And as usual it includes all the futures from earlier versions ( Add an item (go figure:P), select an item, multi select (Shift and Ctrl), delet one, all or just selected, DblClick, reorder, skinable scroller, changable collors and more)

And please vote, I worked on it for a long time and I realy wanna know if you like it - to see if there's any reason to keep publishing it...
